# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

CrowdVision is our Snapdragon Multiverse Hackathon 2026 (Bengaluru) entry.
This file is the shared brain for every teammate's Claude Code session. Keep the
**Current Status** section at the bottom updated as things land.

## What it is (the spine)
An edge-first crowd-safety nervous system: **SENSE → PREDICT → ACT → INFORM**,
frame → red-gate in **< 2 s**, no human in the loop, no frame leaves the venue.

## The contract: `docs/MESSAGES.md` (v9 §e)
**Code to the schema, never to another lane's internals** (Hard Rule 1). If the
right JSON arrives on the right topic, your side works.

Envelope: `{ "type", "v":1, "ts", "src", "seq", "payload" }`.
Every **AI** message carries `inference_backend` / `latency_ms` / `model_id`.
**Commands** carry `playbook_id` / `triggered_by` / `ttl_s`.

Topics: `cv/zone/{id}/density` · `cv/camera/{id}/health` · `cv/gate/{id}/cmd` ·
`cv/gate/{id}/telemetry` · `cv/officer/{id}/beacon` · `cv/incident/new` ·
`cv/dispatch/{officer_id}` · `cv/venue/advisory` · `cv/venue/state` ·
`cv/sys/heartbeat/{device}` (retained + LWT).

Shared implementation of this contract lives in **`crowdvision._lib`**
(`messages.py` envelope/topics/badges, `mqttc.py` paho+LWT, `config.py` YAML
loader). Use it or emit raw JSON — both conform.

## HARD RULES (never violate)
1. **Code to `docs/MESSAGES.md`, never another lane's internals.**
2. **Badges never lie.** `inference_backend`/`latency_ms`/`model_id` reflect what
   ACTUALLY ran: `qnn-npu-hexagon-v73` / `cpu` / `cloud-ai100` / `template-local`
   / `litert-gpu` / `litert-npu` / `sarvam-edge` / `sim-replay`.
3. **NPU verification uses `onnxruntime.get_ep_devices()`, NEVER
   `get_available_providers()`** (ORT 2.x QNN EP is a plugin EP; it won't appear
   in `get_available_providers()`).
4. **Never commit** model weights, `.litertlm/.onnx/.dlc/.pte`, or Qualcomm
   runtime binaries. `download_models.py` fetches at setup with license notices.
5. **All tunables in `config/*.yaml`** — nothing hardcoded.
6. **Every module runnable standalone AND against `sim/`.** `pytest sim/tests`
   passes headless.
7. **Stale-feed policy:** camera LOST > 10 s ⇒ zone `UNKNOWN`, gates **hold**
   state, operator alerted. Fail safe, never guess.
8. **Windows ARM64 host** (Surface X Elite): pure-Python deps only in the Gamma
   lane (paho-mqtt, fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, pyyaml, numpy, opencv-python).
   Broker = mosquitto at the venue, **amqtt** in sim/dev. **`resource/` PDFs are
   confidential — never push them.**

_Ask the human before: adding deps beyond the approved set, changing
`docs/MESSAGES.md`, or touching another lane's stubs beyond their contract._

## Lane ownership (directories are owned; conflicts stay rare)
| Lane | Owner | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Alpha** — Brain | vision + engine | `zone-brain/vision/*`, `zone-brain/engine/*`, `verify_npu.py`, `zone-brain/bench/{detect,mesh}` , `power_delta.ps1` |
| **Beta** — Hands | devices | `gate-node/*` (UNO Q App Lab + Bridge RPC), `field-app/*` (OnePlus Kotlin) |
| **Gamma** — Glue | connect + visible | broker/LWT, `sim/*`, `zone-brain/server/*` (dashboard), `venue-tier/*`, `config/*`, `tools/*`, `bench/` (network + cloud RTT), `_lib/*` |
| **Delta** — Story/Ops | non-code | `README.md`, `docs/*` prose, `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`, benchmarks running, compliance, the clock, narration |

**Coordination notes:**
- `zone-brain/bench/e2e_bench.py` is stubbed for Alpha, but the frame→gate e2e
  semantics are Gamma's per the Role Assignment — it is drivable by `sim/` and
  Gamma's `bench/`. Align before G4.
- `download_models.py`, `setup.ps1`, `run_demo.ps1` live in Alpha's
  `zone-brain/scripts/` but are cross-lane setup — edit by agreement.

## Git / workflow
Trunk-based: small commits straight to `main`, `git pull --rebase` before push,
lanes own their dirs. Repo private until Sun ~11:00, then public before submit.
**Two-strike bug rule** (two 20-min attempts, then the pre-agreed workaround).
**G4 03:00 = FEATURE FREEZE** (bugs + docs only after).

## Gates (Delta's call is final)
G0 14:00 devices/NPU/cloud/≥3 feeds/Bridge echo · G1 17:00 NPU detect <40 ms +
≥3 feeds · G2 21:00 e2e in sim + Sarvam decision · G3 00:30 p95 <2 s, ≥4 feeds ·
**G4 03:00 FREEZE** · G5 09:00 README/benches/Releases/compliance · **G6 SUBMIT
by Sun 12:15**.

## Commands
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"          # editable install + pytest; pulls the approved deps

# Run the full zero-hardware demo (embedded amqtt broker + 5 feeds + decider +
# virtual gate/officer + venue tier + dashboard). Default with no flags = --all.
python -m crowdvision.sim --all
python -m crowdvision.sim --feeds --seconds 10   # one component; auto-stop after 10 s
python -m crowdvision.sim --all --no-dashboard   # skip the FastAPI dashboard
# dashboard: http://localhost:8000  (binds 0.0.0.0 — open from any LAN device)

# Tests (pytest testpaths is pinned to sim/tests in pyproject.toml)
pytest                           # all headless message-loop tests
pytest sim/tests/test_sim_loop.py::test_name -q   # a single test

# Benches — write JSON to bench/out/, then embed into docs/BENCHMARKS.md markers
python -m bench.net_bench        # MQTT throughput + RTT
python -m bench.e2e_bench        # density -> gate p50/p95 (sim)
python -m bench.cloud_rtt_bench  # venue advisory RTT
python -m bench.embed            # fill docs/BENCHMARKS.md from bench/out/*.json (never hand-type numbers)

# Hardware-only (X Elite / cameras — no-ops or informative off-device)
python zone-brain/scripts/verify_npu.py          # prove QNN EP via get_ep_devices()
python tools/calibrate.py --camera c1            # 4-click homography -> config/cameras.yaml
```

## Editing the code (packaging + import gotchas — read before touching cross-dir code)
- **The repo root IS the `crowdvision` package.** `pyproject.toml` sets
  `package-dir = {"crowdvision": "."}`, so `sim/` imports as `crowdvision.sim`
  and `_lib/` as `crowdvision._lib`. `packages` is an explicit list — **if you add
  a new importable subpackage under a mapped dir, add it there** or it won't install.
- **Hyphenated dirs are NOT Python packages.** `zone-brain/`, `venue-tier/`,
  `gate-node/`, `field-app/` are run as scripts. Code in `crowdvision.sim` reaches
  them via `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` (see `sim/__main__.py`
  `_load_venue_tier` / `_start_dashboard`), never `import`. Follow that pattern for
  any new cross-dir wiring; don't try to make them importable.
- **Never hardcode paths or CWD assumptions.** Resolve via
  `crowdvision._lib.config.repo_root()` / `config_dir()`; all tunables load from
  `config/*.yaml` through `config.zones()/cameras()/playbooks()/devices()` (cached).
- **The message contract is code, not just docs:** `crowdvision._lib.messages`
  holds the envelope builder, topic builders, honest backend badge constants, and
  `validate_envelope()` (which sim/tests enforce). Emit via these helpers or raw
  JSON — both must pass `validate_envelope()`. AI types (`zone.density.update`,
  `incident.report`, `venue.advisory`) MUST carry
  `inference_backend`/`latency_ms`/`model_id`; `gate.command` MUST carry
  `playbook_id`/`triggered_by`/`ttl_s` and a valid `action`.
- **MQTT wiring** goes through `crowdvision._lib.mqttc` (paho + LWT + retained
  heartbeat on `cv/sys/heartbeat/{device}`). Broker = embedded amqtt in sim/dev,
  mosquitto (`mosquitto.conf`) at the venue.

---
## ★ BETA: START AT `BETA_HANDOFF.md` ★
Complete handoff for the Beta lane (UNO Q gate node + OnePlus officer app): the
full contract with exact JSON, definition of done, test recipes against the sim
(`--real-gates G3`, `--real-officers officer-1`, `--no-gate`, `--no-officer` let
real hardware replace sim devices without topic fights), and every gotcha
(retained-command TTL, LAN broker at the laptop IP — binds 0.0.0.0 — firewall,
paho 2.x, honest badges). Everything Alpha+Gamma is DONE and verified; Beta is
the only unbuilt lane.

## Alpha review verdict (Gamma, Sat night)
Alpha's merged lane **validated against Build Plan v9**: 10/10 self-tests pass;
density payload = full §e shape (all 16 fields incl. flow_check/temp_source);
badges honest; risk tunables all config-driven (α=.3/60s/10%/5s); Hard Rules 3/5/7
clean; P1→P2→P3 fires with real provenance. **Both §9 seams resolved by Gamma:**
(1) dispatch stays in Gamma's glue — `sim --all --no-feeds` now runs an
escalation-only **dispatcher** (incident + nearest-officer dispatch on RED, badged
`dispatcher:`) while Alpha's engine owns gate.command; (2)
`zone-brain/bench/e2e_bench.py` stub → delegates to Gamma's real `bench/e2e_bench.py`.
Full hardware-path chain verified: Alpha pipeline → gate cmds → dispatcher →
officer ack → venue advisory, zero invalid envelopes.

**Remaining = Beta lane** (UNO Q gate node + OnePlus officer app — sim_gate/
sim_officer mirror the exact topics) **+ X Elite hardware steps** (alpha.md §7:
setup.ps1, model staging, verify_npu, RTSP+calibration, --require-npu, real benches).

## Current Status (keep updated — teammates inherit this)
_Last updated: 2026-07-12 (Sun) by Beta — **Beta lane BUILT; 4 platform bugs fixed.**_

### Beta lane: DONE (was the only unbuilt lane)
- **`gate-node/`** — `python/main.py` fully implemented: paho 2.x, LWT before
  connect, retained-command **TTL discard**, Bridge RPC actuation, ACK telemetry
  (`actuated_ms>0`, echoes `triggered_by`/`playbook_id`) + 1 Hz steady state,
  reconnect backoff, Modulino auto-detect, `--bench`. **Dual-mode**: real
  `arduino.app_bridge` on the UNO Q, `MockBridge` on a laptop — and provenance
  says which (`deterministic-mcu` vs `mock-bridge (laptop)`).
  `sketch/sketch.ino` implemented: `Bridge.provide` × 4, one **`STATE_TABLE`**
  holding every state's colour + matrix pattern, `millis()` SAFE_FLASH blink,
  15 s watchdog → holds LAST_SAFE. **Per-pulse colour is fixed in ONE place**:
  flip `SWAP_RG` if red/green are swapped (GRB LEDs), tune `COLOR_SCALE`.
  Board-specific LED/matrix calls go in the `rgbShow`/`matrixShow` shims.
  _Verified against the sim: ACK+echo, stale retained cmd discarded, LWT fires._
- **`field-app/`** — full Kotlin app (Views, no Compose): foreground service,
  AOSP LocationManager beacons (never fabricates a position), dispatch→ack loop,
  incident screen with FunctionGemma (`-PwithLlm=true`, badge `litert-gpu`) +
  schema gate (invalid ⇒ **no-op**) + dropdown-form fallback, E2B probe,
  benches. Builds to an APK with CLI Gradle (no Android Studio needed).
  _Verified without a phone_: `gradle :app:test` (schema/parser/structurer),
  `tools/check_field_contract.py` (the app's real messages through the REAL
  `validate_envelope`), and `MqttLiveTest` (the shipped Paho client acking a
  live dispatch off the broker).

### Bugs found + fixed (all pre-existing, all on the demo path)
1. **`detect_qnn` badged the NPU while running on the CPU.** In onnxruntime 2.x
   the QNN EP is a *plugin* EP: `InferenceSession(providers=["QNNExecutionProvider"])`
   is **silently ignored** → you get `['CPUExecutionProvider']` on a machine whose
   NPU is plainly visible. The badge came from `get_ep_devices()` alone, so it
   would have stamped `qnn-npu-hexagon-v73` on CPU work (Hard Rule 2 violation).
   Fixed: bind via `SessionOptions.add_provider_for_devices()`, then derive the
   badge from the session's **actual** `get_providers()`. `zone-brain/scripts/npu_smoke.py`
   proves real ops execute on the Hexagon and the badge is earned.
2. **`pip install -e .` failed on Windows ARM64** — i.e. the judges' first
   command, on our own target device. `opencv-python` has **no win-arm64 wheel**
   and its sdist build needs MSVC. Moved to the `[vision]` extra.
3. **The dashboard imported cv2 at module level**, so on the X Elite `sim --all`
   ran with *no dashboard* (the error is swallowed). cv2 there only drew a
   placeholder tile → now optional, with a stdlib BMP fallback.
4. **cv2 removed from the inference path** (`detect_qnn` letterbox+NMS,
   `homography.to_floor`/`perspective_from_points` → numpy). The vision pipeline
   now runs on win-arm64. **Still cv2-only: `capture.py` (RTSP decode)** — real
   cameras need cv2, which cannot be pip-installed on ARM64. See Blockers.
5. **`resource/` PDFs were still tracked** — `.gitignore`'s "never push" section
   was empty. Untracked + ignored (history purge is still a team decision).

_Last updated: 2026-07-11 (Sat, build day) by Gamma._

**TL;DR for Alpha/Beta:** the whole **Gamma lane (glue) is done and on `origin/main`** —
broker, sim mesh, dashboard, venue tier, benches, calibration. `git pull --rebase`,
`pip install -e .`, run `python -m crowdvision.sim --all`, open http://localhost:8000,
then build YOUR lane against these MQTT topics (`docs/MESSAGES.md`). The judges'
3-command path already works end-to-end with zero hardware.

**Scaffold (Phase A):** ✅ DONE, pushed to `origin/main`.
- Packaging (`pip install -e .` verified), `crowdvision._lib`, full `docs/MESSAGES.md`, all lane stubs, config templates, `TEAM_START.md`, README/LICENSE/THIRD_PARTY/.gitignore.

**Gamma lane (Phase B):**
- ✅ **B1 sim harness** — `python -m crowdvision.sim --all` works: embedded amqtt broker + 5 feeds (scripted surge) + decider + virtual gate + virtual officer. Full kill-shot chain fires (density → gate.command → telemetry → incident → nearest-officer dispatch → template-local advisory). `pytest sim/tests` = **5 passed, headless**. Honest badges (`sim-replay`). **This is the integration surface — build your lane against it.**
- ✅ **B2 broker + LWT** — `mosquitto.conf` (venue) + embedded amqtt (sim); `_lib/mqttc` sets LWT + retained heartbeat on `cv/sys/heartbeat/{device}`; gate.command QoS1+retained+TTL.
- ✅ **B3 dashboard** (`zone-brain/server/`) — FastAPI + WebSocket + **vendored Leaflet** (local floorplan CRS, zero internet). Zone polygons recolor by risk, gate icons flip, officer dots, feed-health chips, **provenance decision log**, per-gate **override buttons** → `gate.command` (operator-override). `sim --all` now launches it too, so the judges' path is truly one command → **http://localhost:8000** (binds 0.0.0.0, open from any LAN device). Integration-tested (config API, WS stream, override→telemetry).
- ✅ **B4 venue-tier** (`venue-tier/`) — `aisuite_client.py` (Cloud AI 100 REST via urllib, OpenAI-compatible) auto-falls-back to `template_fallback.py` (real EN/HI/KN templates, badged `template-local`) on missing creds/timeout. `sim_zones.py` = the venue tier: publishes `venue.state` (1 real + 2 SIM zones) + trilingual `venue.advisory` on AMBER/RED; `CV_UPLINK_DOWN=1` simulates the cellular cut. Advisory moved OFF the safety path (decider no longer emits it). Wired into `sim --all`/`--zones`. Tested (6 tests).
- ✅ **B6 network/e2e/cloud benches** (`bench/`) — `net_bench.py` (MQTT throughput + RTT), `cloud_rtt_bench.py` (venue advisory RTT, honest backend), `e2e_bench.py` (density→gate, sim). `embed.py` auto-fills `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` markers from `bench/out/*.json` — **no hand-typed numbers**. Current: e2e density→gate p50 ~8 ms / p95 ~9 ms (sim), MQTT ~960 msg/s. Alpha/Beta fill the NPU/mesh/gate/FunctionGemma markers.
- ✅ **B5 `tools/calibrate.py`** — interactive 4-click homography (`cv2.getPerspectiveTransform`) → writes into `config/cameras.yaml`; `--verify` overlays a 1 m floor grid; non-interactive `--image/--image-points/--floor-size` path for scripting/headless. Verified: image corners map exactly onto the floor rectangle. Config templates (`zones/cameras/playbooks/devices/.env.example`) done earlier.

**Gamma lane: COMPLETE (B1–B6), all on `origin/main`.** Core demo runs end-to-end in sim with zero hardware. `pytest sim/tests` = 6 passed.

**What each other lane plugs into (all live on the broker now):**
- **Alpha** — replace the sim: publish real `zone.density.update` + `camera.health` from `zone-brain/vision/*`; run the real engine (`zone-brain/engine/*`) instead of `sim --feeds` (the sim decider is only for `--all`). Everything you emit shows on the dashboard immediately.
- **Beta** — subscribe `cv/gate/{id}/cmd`, publish `cv/gate/{id}/telemetry`; subscribe `cv/dispatch/{officer_id}`, publish `officer.beacon` + `incident.new`. `sim_gate`/`sim_officer` mirror your exact topics — diff against them.

**Integrate now:** run `python -m crowdvision.sim --all`, open http://localhost:8000, then point your lane's MQTT at `127.0.0.1:1883` and code to `docs/MESSAGES.md`.

**⚠️ Compliance:** the `resource/` PDFs were pushed earlier (commit 8e666da) and are on GitHub. `.gitignore` blocks them going forward; purge/private decision pending with Sachin.

**Blockers / next actions (need a human or the venue hardware):**
1. **Stage the models.** Not on this laptop: `weights/vision/yolov8n_det_int8.onnx`
   (AI Hub export — must be exported on x86/WSL2; torch has no win-arm64 wheel)
   and `Mobile_actions_q8_ekv1024.litertlm` (FunctionGemma). Everything around
   them is wired and proven; only the files are missing.
   `python zone-brain/scripts/download_models.py --local <dir>`
2. **`config/.env`** exists but `AISUITE_ENDPOINT`/`AISUITE_KEY` are blank, so the
   venue advisory is honestly badged `template-local`. Fill them → `cloud-ai100`.
3. **Real cameras need cv2, which will not install on the X Elite** (win-arm64).
   Options: run `capture.py` on an x64 box, or swap the RTSP decode for
   `imageio-ffmpeg`/an `ffmpeg` subprocess (needs the dep sign-off in HARD RULES).
   The NPU, engine, gates, officers, dashboard and benches are all cv2-free now.
4. **README team table still has 4 placeholder names/emails** — Rules §7.c.ii
   makes this a submission blocker.
5. **`resource/` PDFs are still in git history** (commit 8e666da) and the repo
   goes public. Untracking stops new pushes; purging history is Sachin's call.
6. On the board: paste the working LED/matrix calls into `sketch.ino`'s
   `rgbShow`/`matrixShow` shims and confirm the App Lab manifest keys + FQBN.
